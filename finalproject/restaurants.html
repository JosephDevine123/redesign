							<h2>Luquillo kiosks (or kioskos)</h2>
							<p>The Luquillo de kioskos are a much loved part of Puerto Rico. This long row of humble (think almost ramshackle) buildings is right on Route 3 along the beach in Luquillo. But don’t let their appearance discourage you - stop in and you will be in for an experience that is uniquely Puerto Rican.</p>
							<p>You can stop by for a simple snack or just an ice-cold beer, or take some time and enjoy a "real" nice, sit-down meal. Or just bar hop and skip the food, if you can resist! A number of places will have live music in the evenings (especially on weekend nights). There are even a few with pool tables. Stop in and enjoy, but don’t bother to get dressed up — come as you are and relax.</p>
							<p>Another one cool thing about the kiosks is that they are fun and casual, with open air dining. One side of the restaurants opens to the parking lot and Route 3, and on a number of them, they are open toward the beach as well. So some have a beach view!</p>
							<p>The kiosks are very different and range in style, taste, and price. You can get humble local fried goodies like bacalaítos, alcapurrias, pastelillos/empanadillas or even rice & beans, and a cold beer, for just a few bucks. You can also get much more unusual things like Pizza, local/Caribbean fusion, Chinese, Italian, and even Peruvian food. This mixing of the new cuisine and the classic Puerto Rican food kiosk now offers something for everyone.</p>
							<p>The Luquillo kiosks are about 60 different places, each of them are numbered and many of them are named. A few sell souvenirs, and some are specialty bars. But most of these kiosks sell food and drinks. Some of these places have been run by the same family for over 20 years, while others are brand new and recently opened. It is hard to say which ones are the best — it all depends on what you feel like eating! But most people will eventually have a favorite — just ask a local and you’ll find out for yourself!</p>

								<h3>La Parrilla, Bar and Grill (kiosko de loquillo)</h3>

From the freshest seafood of local fisherman, to the freshiest ingrediants and flavors the island has to offer. This restaurant has a rustic ambiance, located part of the Liquillo de Kiosko.
