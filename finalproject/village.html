				<h3>Rio Mar's Location</h3>
				<p>Rio Mar is a gated resort community located in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, about 45 minutes east of San Juan. It is an ocean front community nestled between Melia Coco Beach resort to the northwest, Luquillo Beach to the southeast, and El Yunque to the southwest. This location makes for many stunning views, from early morning sunsets over the ocean to majestic rainforest mountain scenes. Although the community is fairly large, you are never more than a short walk or golf cart ride away from swimming in the ocean waves.</p>

					<h3>Getting to Puerto Rico</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p style="font-size:16px">A big benefit of visiting Rio Mar is that it is one of the easiest destinations to visit in the Caribbean as a US Citizen. Since Puerto Rico is a US Territory, travel to Puerto Rico is considered domestic for all US residents. This means that you do not need a passport to visit Puerto Rio. Also, your debit and credit cards will work here as they will in the states, as will your cell phone. All restaurants and stores take the US dollar and in most tourist locations you will find fluent English speakers. This makes visiting Rio Mar a perfect Caribbean vacation destination for US citizens!</p>
					<p>Fortunately, Rio Mar is located close to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, the main airport in San Juan, and the largest on the island. This airport has regular flights from the US mainland including many direct flights from the east coast</p>
					<p>Once you have landed in Puerto Rico, you will need to get to the town of Rio Grande. One option is to rent a car. For first time visitors to Puerto Rico, I would not recommend this option unless you are comfortable and familiar driving in other countries, or you plan to visit several different parts of the island. Although Puerto Rico is technically US soil, driving is more like what you would experience in Central America. Many roads are rough and the signage is poor. Also, the highway from San Juan to Rio Mar is a toll road, so you can save a few dollars by hiring a cab to take you instead. The other option is to hire a driver or Uber to take you to Rio Mar from the airport.<br>
